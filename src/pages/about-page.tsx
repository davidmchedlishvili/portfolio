          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>Before joining Revature LLC, I spent considerable time in Bio-Technology academic research and proudly earned a Ph.D. degree in this field. Alongside, I have accumulated 4 years of IT experience and have further strengthened my professional qualifications by obtaining 3 Salesforce certificates. My academic background and professional journey have always been complemented by my innate passion for coding and problem-solving. What truly invigorates me in a software engineering career is the opportunity not just to find solutions but also to assist others in navigating their technical challenges.</p>

          <p>Diving a bit into my personal life, I currently reside in Virginia with my loving wife and our two children. Outside of my professional commitments, I'm an avid soccer player. This sport doesn't just keep me active but also fortifies the essence of teamwork in me. Additionally, strumming on my guitar is my preferred way to unwind, offering me moments of relaxation amidst a bustling life. Throughout, I have always been driven by my attributes of motivation, trustworthiness, and analytical thinking, ensuring that I approach each professional challenge with enthusiasm and dedication.</p>
